TODO
----

* use for (var i = 0; myArray[i++];) instead of i<myArray.length

* add entry to popup menu when registering

WONTFIX
-------

* ability to hide windows individually/globally

* disable notifications for excluded mail account servers. NOTE: toggle
  `login_at_startup` and `check_new_mail` is a bad idea. Mainly because the
  user may be toggling them after we store the previous values (and before we
  restore them)

* convert to a
  [Bootstrapped extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions),
  nor to an JetPack/Restartable because not supported yet by Thunderbird


ROADMAP
-------

* Mozilla products have entered a
  [rapid release cycle](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/04/13/new-channels-for-firefox-rapid-releases/
  "Mozilla Blog") which implies frequent rebuilds of XPCOM binary-based addons (such as Firetray)
* authors are encouraged to [port their XPCOM binary-based addons to js-ctypes](https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.extensions/browse_thread/thread/2d6942c44f303b62/b98debfbccef11ed)
* Francesco doesn't have enough time to maintain the Firetray project in this situation
* Foudil has come up with a prototype js-ctypes version of the project, which is functional, but does not yet cover all features currently supported by the binary-based version.
* the js-ctypes version will endeavor to support uncovered features in the
  future (see below)
* the Firetray project plans to replace the binary-based version with the js-types version when enough features are covered
* meanwhile, Firetray users are invited to switch to the preview release of the js-ctypes version [link to beta channel] and [provide feedback](https://github.com/foudfou/FireTray/issues) as to what important features are missing

NEXT FEATURES
-------------

* mouse scrolls on tray icon hides/shows
* hide to tray on minimize
* ability to start minimized to tray
* when restoring if the window is iconified, deiconify it
* custom tray icon
* keyboard shortcut hide/show
